# Leap Motion Proof of Concept
In this Exploration I looked at the basic connection with the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) sensor. 
During this exploration I used [this](https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/cpp/devguide/Sample_Tutorial.html) tutorial as reference.

It's only function is to establish the connection with the device and when it has new data print it to the console.

I'm planning to extend this project to create a new way of interacting with VST plug-ins.
