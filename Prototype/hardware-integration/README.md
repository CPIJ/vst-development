# Hardware Integration
In an earlier Exploration [project](https://github.com/CPIJ/vst-development/tree/master/Exploration/leap-motion-poc) I experimented with the Leap Motion sensor. I decided to integrate this sensor in a basic sound generator. 

It's use is simple. When the Leap Motion detects one hand, it will allow a noise signal to play. This Prototype is a simple demonstration, but there are many interesting possibilities with this sensor. I will experiment with those in different Explorations and Prototypes.
