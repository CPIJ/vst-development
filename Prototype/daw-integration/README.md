# DAW Integration
This is Prototype #1. I created this project to experiment with JUCE and how to export the project to a plugin that works in DAWs. It's function is very simple, push a key and a sine wave plays the corrosponding tone.

## Installation
[Click here](https://github.com/CPIJ/vst-development/raw/master/Releases/DawIntegration.dll) to download the `.dll` file. Place it in your local VST folder and refresh the plugins in your DAW.
Enjoy!
